# kstd

A `#[no_std]` standard library the [martimos kernel](https://github.com/martimos/kernel).
It contains a lot of basic building blocks.
This project exists, because it kind of forces a cleaner architecture
for the kernel, and testing is really easy since we can use
the normal test framework here.

Currently, it is probably more informative to look at the
sky rather than to read this README. However, feel free to
look at code comments and the code itself.
